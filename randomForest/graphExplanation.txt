#Explanation of the Graphical Data 

gini - Shows the impurity (How mixed up the dataset is w/h different classes) (0 indicates only one class) (Can be entropy too)
samples - Number of unique samples 
value - [] The number of samples in order [itemPrice, item, name, total]
class - majority class 

The discrepancy between samples and value 
  - Due to the nature of RandomForest using bootstrap w/h replacment for the samples the total value count and samples do not add up.
    This is due to the fact that samples have only the unique count. 
    Value has the entire bootstrapped Sample w/h (replacement) 
      Further Explanation: 
        samples = 335
        value = [225, 220, 45, 23]
        samples != value
        This just means that value is the bootstrapped sample w/h replacement but in this bootstrap sample there are only 335 unique values that made 
        it to this particular node. Thus, in this example, a lot of duplicates exist in the bootstrapped sample
