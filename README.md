## Description
Simple as Pick, Pic, and Paid
- Pick the friends (Select all the friends participating in the event)
- Pic the receipts (Take pictures of all the reciepts used)
- Paid by venmo (The app calculates everything and sends venmo request so you get paid)

## How it works
We take the photo of the reciept and pass it through our YOLO model that extracts the name, item, item price, and total of the reciept. We then use the item prices, total, and the percent tip given to us by the user to calculate how much each person has to pay if it was even distrubed.
